## Resubmission
This is a resubmission. In this version I have:

* Added graphics::legend, stats::coef and stats::vcov to NAMESPACE.

## Test environments

* Windows 7, R version 3.1.3
* OS X Yosemite 10.10.2, R version 3.2.2

## R CMD check results

There were no ERRORs, or WARNINGs. 

There was one NOTE:

* checking CRAN incoming feasibility ... NOTE

New maintainer:
  Alberto Garre <garre.alberto@gmail.com>
Old maintainer(s):
  Alberto Garre Perez <garre.alberto@gmail.com>
  
The second family name has been removed from the authors.
The e-mail has not been modified, so this NOTE should be irrelevant.

## Reverse dependencies

I have run devtools::revdep_check() and every package passed.
