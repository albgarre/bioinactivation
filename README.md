bioinactivation: a package for modelling microbial inactivation in R.
---------------------------------------------------------------------

The **bioinactivation** package implements several function for the modelization of microbial inactivation in R. It includes:

-   functions for the prediction of isothermal or non-isothermal microbial inactivation.
-   functions for the adjustment of inactivation models to isothermal experiments.
-   functions for the fitting of inactivation models to dynamic experiments.
-   functions for the calculation of prediction intervals for isothermal or non-isothermal microbial inactivation processes.

The inactivation models most commonly used in industry and academia are implemented in this package:

-   Bigelow's model.
-   Peleg's model.
-   Mafart's model.
-   Geeraerd's model.

Furthermore, this package includes some training data sets mimicking isothermal and non-isothermal inactivation experiments.

A user friendly web interface to every function in the package can be found in:
