## bioinactivation: a package for modelling microbial inactivation in R.

The bioinactivation package implements several function for the modelization of microbial inactivation in R. It includes:

* functions for the prediction of isothermal and non-isothermal microbial inactivation.
* functions for the adjustment of inactivation models to isothermal experiments.
* functions for the fitting of inactivation models to dynamic experiments.
